I once was a consultant, and struggled to find a mission I loved.
Everything I was offered was far from my vision of an engineer.

For months, I couldn't find the right mission. ❌
I knew one thing: I wanted to make a BIG IMPACT, and to be an engineer working on ADVANCED topics.

One day, I questioned my techniques and my approach, and everything changes ✅
I started to learn about self-driving cars, and I found a job as a Computer Vision Engineer in self-driving cars.

In all of that, I got one major thing:
👉 To work on advanced fields, you must acquire advanced skills, and work on them daily.
What you learned at school 5 years ago is probably already outdated.

📩 So I started to share my tips to a mailing list, to help engineers.
If you subscribe to it, you'll receive an email every day, sharing technical content, career tips, or insider stories.
These emails are currently helping over 4,000 engineers every day accross the world.
And many of them found a job with these emails alone.

🚀 I also have a course platform, where you'll learn to build and brand advanced projects.
Students of these courses LEARNED A LOT and FOUND THEIR DREAM JOBS.

Leaving Mississippi in a U-haul, she drove straight to Kansas, for her Master’s I/O psych. Beth learned a great deal in Kansas, including snow. She interned at Kansas Enterprise Technology Corp (KTEC) as an Ewing Marion Kauffman scholar. There, she got her first taste of Angel & VC funded businesses. Her work there was mostly in Org Design &Job Analysis. Rather than poke her eyes out with a spoon, she elected to cut her recruiting teeth and volunteered to lead the firm’s recruiting efforts. Teeth firmly sharpened, she headed over the mountains and thru the woods back to TN, dragging her now 7 & 9-year-old showstoppers with her. There, she landed a recruiter gig at Dell’s then start-up, beginning the path of how ""Beth knows everybody"". She moved on to WebMd’s Nashville ops where she lead recruiting, and fell face-first into the abyss of healthcare. Iterations and acquisitions later, she ended up at Emdeon leading the whole shebang. In 2013, Showstoppers all educated, she firmed up the business plan she’d always had (with bodacious help) on a napkin over a beer, & founded Franklin-Belle. Turns out, it pays not to be a jerk to people over the course of your career, straight-no chaser. Beth is also a member of the VC group, NueCura, in Nashville. Where she still doesn’t do Org Design or Job analysis.
Beth graduated with her PhD at the Chicago College of Psychology in Behavioral Analytics in 2020 in the middle of a Pandemic right after the East Nashville Tornado. She also talks about this journey in public, sometimes, & does a bit 1x1 opinion-giving as a side hustle. Also, failed the MENSA test, that one of her showstoppers passed and never let's her forget it. Frequent snarly LI contributor. Disclaimer: Beth's PR firm hates this bio.

He tenido la oportunidad de implementar proyectos que no solo ofrecen un producto sino que también una experiencia de consumo como ""pre-compra de equipaje"" y ""asciende tu experiencia"", en ambos proyectos se trata de empoderar al cliente, ademas he sido capaz de gestionar benchmark para anticiparnos a la competencia.

En el negocio de Carga, adquiri expiriencia en la parte operacional y de calidad, estuve encargado de gestionar las novedades que surgen entre las diferentes estaciones (mas de 56 estaciones que incluyen la mayoría de países del continente Americano y de algunas de Europa como Madrid, Barcelona y Londres) en base a las restricciones de la IATA y de los procedimientos internos, todo con el fin de brindar los estándares mas altos en seguridad y comercialización de la carga.

En el área de Revenue he tenido mi mayor crecimiento personal, liderando diferentes proyectos y foros que han permitido disminuir costos e incrementar los ingresos para todo el holding, obtuve la mayor nota para Avianca en la certificación de Inventario, curso de Amadeus impartido en Niza, Francia.

En las diferentes áreas en las que he estado, me he enfocado en brindar el mejor servicio a los clientes internos y a los externos. Entre los éxitos incluyen la implementación de programas de experiencia y el seguimiento de calidad que se le da al mayor grupo exportador de flores de Colombia, ahorro de $12,000.00 anuales implementando auto procesos en el área de Distribución.

Mis compañeros me conocen como una persona capaz, eficiente, honesta y creativa en el que se puede confiar para llegar a un nuevo enfoque ya que dedico mucho tiempo a entender el mercado antes de sugerir ideas. En mi puesto actual tengo una gran independencia, pero sin duda el trabajo en equipo permite que se alcanzan metas conjuntas de manera mas eficiente.

Tengo una Licenciatura en Administración de empresas que me enorgullece haber cumplido en un ciclo menos de lo general y terminando con un CUM alto, que me permitió omitir la tesis y ser parte del Seminario de Alta Gerencia de la UCA.

Actualmente considero que estoy en un momento de crecimiento profesional y personal por lo que estoy buscando un cambio que me ayude a alcanzar dichos objetivos.",Analista de Revenue Management en Avianca Holdings S.A.,El Salvador,Rodrigo Damas,167,Avianca Holdings S.A.,https://www.linkedin.com/company/aviancataca-limited/,Analista de Revenue Management

¡Entonces puedo ayudarte!

Soy Coach Organizacional certificada por la ICF con más de 20 años de experiencia laboral y de consultoría.

¿Qué puedo hacer por ti?

Servir de interlocutor neutral para decirles a los líderes de tu organización la verdad de lo que sucede con ellos, de manera asertiva, pero que muchos no se atreven por estar en una situación de desventaja o temor.

Puedo trabajar con ellos para mostrarles como están impactando negativa y positivamente desde su estilo de liderazgo a sus equipos de trabajo y a la empresa en general.

Adicionalmente, los acompañaré a darse cuenta de que ellos son responsables directos de que su gente logre o no alcanzar los objetivos que se hayan propuesto y no que la responsabilidad es exclusiva de sus colaboradores.

¿Cómo puedo ayudarte?

Identificando falencias y fortalezas y entregándoles herramientas a la medida de la organización, para que puedan tener las conversaciones necesarias con la persona correcta en el momento indicado, ayudándoles a abrir los canales de comunicación que antes estaban cerrados.

Propiciando espacios de construcción entre los líderes y sus equipos o entre líderes y sus pares, para que todos trabajen de manera asertiva en como está siendo la forma de relacionarse y la realidad que están generando día a día para ellos mismos y para las familias que de cada uno depende.

¿Te importa la gente y buscas que ellos estén bien para que tu compañía esté aún mejor?

Es aquí donde mi trabajo radica, en poder acompañar a las empresas a través de sus procesos de formación a aprovechar de la mejor forma su talento humano.

¿Cómo puedes contactarme?
