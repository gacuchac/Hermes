Aside from the math, algebra, programming skills, etc... It is crucial to understand how you pretend to solve business needs by following the right approach.

I want to share an accurate quote from an article written by Thomas Meakin, Jeremy Palmer, Valentina Sartori, and Jamie Vickers (A McKinsey article):

""AI is etched in the collective mindset (“We are AI enabled”), rather than simply applied opportunistically (´Here’s a use case where AI can add value´).""
Link at the end of this post. ""Add Value"" are the keywords...

Special thanks to Applaudo Studios to push us towards new endeavors. Thanks to Udacity and my instructor Ed Wiley, PhD who provided assistance and dedicated tons of time to build this executive program in such an organized manner.

En esta iniciativa nos acompañan socios privados y, por supuesto, la desarrollamos en coordinación con entidades del sector público, como el Ministerio de Economía y la Secretaría de Innovación, dando vida a la visión 2025 del Grupo BID, que nos marca el camino para seguir tomando acciones que no dejen a nadie atrás y nos ayuden superar los crecientes desafíos de la región.

Only in the last 18 months, they've successfully closed 2 tremendous rounds of funding and doubled the size of their engineering team.

It's no secret how helpful and the great work Glovo did during the lockdown and hardest times of the pandemic, not only in Spain but in every country they operate. Seeing the positive impact that their work has on society is what makes me believe and be sure that a partnership between Glovo and Applaudo Studios would be something worth exploring.

Onboarding those new 100 engineers in Madrid is not an easy task, lucky for you Applaudo can help supplement your team to keep crushing goals and reaching out to new heights. We're ready to work with you! #glovo #codethatchangeslives",Other,,

... Finally, I have completed the last piece in my training that has allowed me to lay the foundations in an exciting specialization, learning about deep learning applications, sensors, state of the art of computer vision, robotics, etc.

Looking back at the number of experiences accumulated through all the projects, it is undoubtedly gratifying, the adventure is just beginning, but I am sure that it is the starting point to continue growing professionally by holistically applying all the knowledge and experience acquired.

Many thanks to my teachers, mentors, colleagues, partners, #Udacity, and Applaudo Studios, for the opportunity to offer the world significant improvements through the application of our work and knowledge...

Joy and happiness are a reward that results from doing something you love, like being with your family, planning vacations, help others, value our liberty and something that I thought that I would never say is: I really love, enjoy, and cherish what I do for living. ☝🏼

Nowadays, we are all life-long learners; AI/ML is not the future, it is happening now and we need to adopt, embrace, assume and appropriate these changes for good; each day is a great day to start. 🙌

3.5 months, two Nanodegrees, and 1 executive program; looking forward to a new one around Data Science in Udacity; thank you Applaudo Studios we are going for more.

Special thanks to my friend, partner, and AI mentor Rafael Castro, we are going places working towards our goals and community. 💪

Despues de casi 2 años de estar apoyando en este proyecto y ver la cantidad de personas y partners que se sumaron para dar con tantísimo amor su esfuerzo a esta causa; no se imaginan lo felíz que me siento de verlo arrancar.

Me quedaría corto contandoles cuántos han apoyado pero gracias a Applaudo Studios por darme la oportunidad de llevar el proyecto más importante de mi vida (una parte). No se imaginan todo el amor que ha movido montañas para que ésto inicie, se desarrolle (en todo sentido) y ahora tenga un inicio. En el video podrán ver todos los que han participado.

¿Y ustedes ya donaron? Es re-fácil, vean los detalles pero su donación hara posible que se ayude a muchas personas victimas de abuso sexual en su infancia, algunas sufriendo en silencio, pero el objetivo es que eventualmente conviertan su testimonio en Manuales Para Sobrevivir, iniciativa de fundación Humans for Humans.

El problema es serio... cuesta verlo, pero lo primero es generar conciencia.

When I started to work at Applaudo Studios, I felt overwhelmed 'cause it wasn't my field of job. I always worked at Advertising Agency's, with a little Web Design projects. But it was awesome find people that helped me to growt up and keep learning always. I'm so greatful with Laura Escobar, Gabriel Guevara for being like a Jedi Master's to me on the UX/UI Design. With Gabriela Magana and César Sánchez for being always a helping hand when I have doubts.

Now this is one of the achievements. And it's just the firts one of several certifications that I'm getting on The Interaction Design Foundation.

And one of the best advice that I can give it's: keep learning, keep improving yourself. It's the best thing that I've learned at Applaudo Studios and The Interaction Design Foundation.

Thank's for this Xmas Gift!!!

Ed avrebbero ragione: il premio “Il mio prodotto del cuore”. è qualcosa di speciale perchè i vincitori sono decretati dai voti del “Re Cliente”, ossia, dai consumatori che hanno acquistato e provato i prodotti in gara. Insomma: i clienti ci premiano.

Cosa vogliamo di più?

Nel resto d’Europa questa indagine di mercato, che finisce con l'assegnazione del premio, si chiama “Best Product of the Year”, ma noi italiani siamo degli inguaribili romanticoni: per questo in Italia si chiama “Il mio prodotto del cuore”.

Ringrazio pubblicamente lo Studio Orlandini (bravissima Beatrice Orlandini!) e Largo Consumo, che nonostante le grandi difficoltà di quest’anno non hanno rinunciato a questa iniziativa, mobilitando una macchina pazzesca fatta di marchi, prodotti e spietati clienti, messa in moto completamente on line (premiazione compresa).

Ancora una volta applaudo gli affiliati 101CAFFE' Italia’, che hanno fatto conoscere questo caffè così speciale a partire dal suo nome (Gran Milano) ed alla mia squadra, di cui in questa foto si vede una parziale ma significativa rappresentanza, a maggioranza femminile (e per questo funziona alla grande).

I've always thought what would be the most effective way to reduce this not only in the U.S but in the entire world. That's why Misfits Market project is very close to my heart. They are not only contributing to reduce that waste but they're also putting on our table 100% organic produce at a lower price. I'm sure this series B funding represents a HUGE milestone for what's comming ahead.
