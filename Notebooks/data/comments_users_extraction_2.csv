I once was a consultant, and struggled to find a mission I loved.
Everything I was offered was far from my vision of an engineer.

For months, I couldn't find the right mission. ❌
I knew one thing: I wanted to make a BIG IMPACT, and to be an engineer working on ADVANCED topics.

One day, I questioned my techniques and my approach, and everything changes ✅
I started to learn about self-driving cars, and I found a job as a Computer Vision Engineer in self-driving cars.

In all of that, I got one major thing:
👉 To work on advanced fields, you must acquire advanced skills, and work on them daily.
What you learned at school 5 years ago is probably already outdated.

📩 So I started to share my tips to a mailing list, to help engineers.
If you subscribe to it, you'll receive an email every day, sharing technical content, career tips, or insider stories.
These emails are currently helping over 4,000 engineers every day accross the world.
And many of them found a job with these emails alone.

🚀 I also have a course platform, where you'll learn to build and brand advanced projects.
Students of these courses LEARNED A LOT and FOUND THEIR DREAM JOBS.
